    </h3>
    <h4>
        April 2024 - PRESENT
As a member of the Formula Manipal Driverless team, I work on
 autonomous navigation by integrating ROS and Gazebo simulations. 
 Using camera data, we detect cones, create waypoints, and calculate 
 steering and thrust values through model predictive control. 
 Currently, I am focused on developing hardware systems, specifically
  brake-by-wire and steer-by-wire, to bring this setup from simulation to the actual car.
   This role deepens my expertise in autonomous systems, simulation tools, and vehicle dynamics.
